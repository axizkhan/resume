  "email": "your.email@example.com",
  "phone": "123-456-7890",
  "summary": "A brief summary about yourself.",
  "experience": [
    {
      "jobTitle": "Job Title",
      "company": "Company Name",
      "dates": "Start Date - End Date",
      "description": "A brief description of your responsibilities."
    }
  ],
  "education": [
    {
      "degree": "Degree",
      "school": "School Name",
      "dates": "Start Date - End Date"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Styling

You can modify the `styles.css` file to change colors, fonts, and layouts. Here are some common changes you might consider:

- **Font Family**: Change the font to something that reflects your style.
- **Colors**: Adjust the background and text colors to improve readability.
- **Margins and Padding**: Change spacing to make your resume look more organized.

1. **Push Your Changes**: Make sure your changes are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.
2. **Enable GitHub Pages**: Go to your repository settings, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages.
